# Contributing to Awesome GEO

Thanks for helping improve Awesome GEO. You can contribute **platforms** (sites where you build GEO presence) or **repos & tools** (open-source projects for GEO optimization).

This repo is the source of truth for the catalog: data files, verification scripts, and the generated README.

## Quick start

1. Pick the right data file
2. Add your entry at the bottom
3. Submit a PR
4. CI automatically verifies your submission
5. Maintainer reviews + merges

Or just [open an issue](https://github.com/deeflect/awesome-geo/issues/new/choose) — we have templates for both platforms and repos.

## Adding a Platform

### Data structure

- `data/categories.yaml` — category definitions
- `data/sites/*.yaml` — one YAML array per category

### Required fields

```yaml
- name: Platform Name
  url: https://example.com
  category: developer-profiles    # must match filename
  description: One-line summary
  sampleProfile: https://example.com/user/someone   # real public page, not homepage
```

### Optional fields

`dr`, `linkType`, `effort`, `verified`, `lastVerified`, `geoScore`, `geoTier`, `geoSignals`, `aiAccess`, `indexable`, `profileLinkDofollow`, `aiCrawled`

You don't need to fill these — CI calculates them automatically.

### What CI checks (platforms)

| Check | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| Robots.txt | AI bot access detected for 7 crawlers |
| Authority | Normalized authority via OpenPageRank |
| Link type | Dofollow/nofollow analysis on sample page |
| Indexability | HTTP status, noindex tags, meta robots |
| GEO Score | Composite score calculated (0-100) |

CI posts a verification report as a PR comment. Results: ✅ Verified, ⚠️ Low GEO value, ❌ Failed.

### Platform guidelines

- Free platforms only
- One platform per PR preferred
- Use a real public listing/profile URL for `sampleProfile`, not the homepage
- No spammy or low-value directories
- Keep descriptions short and factual
- Don't remove unrelated entries

  url: https://github.com/owner/repo-name
  category: geo-toolkits              # must match filename
  description: One-line summary of what it does
  stars: 150                          # approximate, CI verifies

| Age | At least 7 days old |
| Not archived | Must be actively available |
| Not a fork | Must be the original repo |
| Activity | Warns if no commits in 365+ days |

CI posts a verification report as a PR comment. Results: ✅ Verified, ⚠️ Review, ❌ Failed.

### Repo guidelines
